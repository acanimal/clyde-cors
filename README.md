Filter to enable Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) capabilities on Clyde API gateway, allowing to make AJAX requests from client side.

> Implementation is based on [cors](https://github.com/expressjs/cors) module.

## Configuration

CORS filter bypasses the configuration options to [cors](https://github.com/expressjs/cors) module, so you can use the same options:

* `origin`: Configures the **Access-Control-Allow-Origin** CORS header. Possible values:
 - `Boolean` - set `origin` to `true` to reflect the [request origin](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-abarth-origin-09), as defined by `req.header('Origin')`, or set it to `false` to disable CORS. 
 - `String` - set `origin` to a specific origin. For example if you set it to `"http://example.com"` only requests from "http://example.com" will be allowed.
 - `RegExp` - set `origin` to a regular expression pattern which will be used to test the request origin. If it's a match, the request origin will be reflected. For example the pattern `/example\.com$/` will reflect any request that is coming from an origin ending with "example.com".
 - `Array` - set `origin` to an array of valid origins. Each origin can be a `String` or a `RegExp`. For example `["http://example1.com", /\.example2\.com$/]` will accept any request from "http://example1.com" or from a subdomain of "example2.com".
 - `Function` - set `origin` to a function implementing some custom logic. The function takes the request origin as the first parameter and a callback (which expects the signature `err [object], allow [bool]`) as the second.
* `methods`: Configures the **Access-Control-Allow-Methods** CORS header. Expects a comma-delimited string (ex: 'GET,PUT,POST') or an array (ex: `['GET', 'PUT', 'POST']`).
* `allowedHeaders`: Configures the **Access-Control-Allow-Headers** CORS header. Expects a comma-delimited string (ex: 'Content-Type,Authorization') or an array (ex: `['Content-Type', 'Authorization']`). If not specified, defaults to reflecting the headers specified in the request's **Access-Control-Request-Headers** header.
* `exposedHeaders`: Configures the **Access-Control-Expose-Headers** CORS header. Expects a comma-delimited string (ex: 'Content-Range,X-Content-Range') or an array (ex: `['Content-Range', 'X-Content-Range']`). If not specified, no custom headers are exposed.
* `credentials`: Configures the **Access-Control-Allow-Credentials** CORS header. Set to `true` to pass the header, otherwise it is omitted.
* `maxAge`: Configures the **Access-Control-Allow-Max-Age** CORS header. Set to an integer to pass the header, otherwise it is omitted.
* `preflightContinue`: Pass the CORS preflight response to the next handler.

## Examples

### Enable all CORS requests

```javascript
{
  "prefilters": [
    {
      "id": "cors",
      "path": "clyde-cors"
    }
  ],

  "providers": [
    {
      "id": "provider",
      "context": "/provider",
      "target": "http://server"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Enable CORS requests only from `myserver` origin and on `provider`

```javascript
{
  "providers": [
    {
      "id": "provider",
      "context": "/provider",
      "target": "http://provider_server",
      "prefilters": [
        {
          "id": "cors",
          "path": "clyde-cors",
          "config": {
            "origin": "http://myserver"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Notes

* It must be configured as a global or provider's prefilter. It has no sense as a postfilter.
